# PDF Coordinate Finder

## _Introduction_
This program allows the user to view the coordinates of any point on any pdf document. 

My motivation for this program arose during the development of leasing-helper, which uses the PyFPDF library to populate pdfs with text and shapes. The PyFPDF library requires specific x and y coordinates to write to a document. I quickly became frustrated with the daunting task of finding 172 different coordinates on a single document. After researching existing tools online, I realized I needed to develop something more flexible to fit my needs.

## _Advantages_
This program has specific advantages over preexisting tools.
pdf-coordinate-finder can:
- Store each coordinate in one place
- Label each coordinate
- Adjust each coordinate by a specific value
- Align the y values of multiple coordinates

While this list comprises the current functionality of pdf-coordinate-finder, I know there is room for improvement when I work with pdfs again.
In the future, pdf-coordinate-finder could:
- Convert x and y values to different units
- Offer streamlined coordinate alignment
- Gather similar coordinates with less user input
- Label coordinates automatically

## _Usage_
